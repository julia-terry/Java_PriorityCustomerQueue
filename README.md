# Java_PriorityCustomerQueue
This is a Java project made in NetBeans that replicates a 60 minute period of servicing customers in a line. In these 60 minutes we do the following:
<pre>
  1. Randomly add customers including a random amount of minutes they will take and what priority they have
      â€¢ If they have priority over the other customers we currently have, move them up in line
  2. Note when we fully service a customer 
  3. Keep track of how many customers we serviced overall
  4. Keep track of the maximum line length we reached 
</pre>
